# backstagetalks

This project is a clone of Backstage Talks, a magazine known for its casual yet insightful conversations on design and business. Inspired by their website, I aimed to clone its visually appealing and engaging aspects, particularly the vibrant color scheme they have employed. The primary objective of this project was to learn and implement fixed positioning and scroll behavior techniques. By working on this project, I gain a deeper understanding of these specific web design features.
